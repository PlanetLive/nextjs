# model.earth

Our EarthDay Project Goals:

1. Display the content of public folders (from GitHub, AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
2. Add display processes that are automatically driven by the file types (image rotation, video display, etc.).

## GitHub Copilot

Add yourself to the [copilot waitlist](https://github.com/features/copilot/signup)

## nextjs

The content in the current repository is built from these 
[setup steps](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres) using Node.js, Next.js, 
Prisma, and PostgreSQL (or MySQL) with TypeScript.
