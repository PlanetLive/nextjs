Our EarthDay Project Goal:

1. Use NextJS with Prisma to display the content of a public folder.  
(From GitHub, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
2. Find and add processes that are automatically driven by the file types (image rotation, video display, etc.).
3. Work on integrations with other Earth Day projects.

## nextjs

The content in the current repository is built from these 
[setup steps](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres) using Node.js, Next.js, 
Prisma, and PostgreSQL (or MySQL) with TypeScript.
